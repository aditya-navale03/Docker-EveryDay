# What is docker 
Docker is like a box/container where you pack your whole project — code, libraries, tools, environment — everything in one single package.

1. Your app will run same on any computer, no “it works on my system” problem.
2. You don’t need to install Java, MySQL, Python, Node separately on every machine.
3. Just run the Docker container and your app runs instantly.
4. Think of it like a virtual small computer created only for your application.

## inshort 
👉 Docker means putting your entire project in a container so it runs anywhere without setup problems.
